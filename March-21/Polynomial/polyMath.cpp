// Program to use (test) univariate polynomials with a user interface. 
// Commands supported 
// -> input two polynomials
// -> calculate their sum
// -> get the coefficients of some terms
// -> get the degree of the polynomial
// -> evaluate the polynomial given a specific value for x.
// -> get the number of terms in the polynomial
// -> possibly differentiate
// usage: polyMath -batch < inFile.txt > outFile.txt
// to run program non-interactively obtaining data from inFile.txt
// putting the output into outFile.txt
//
// usage: polyMath
